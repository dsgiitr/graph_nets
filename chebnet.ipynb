    "As a part of this blog series, this time we would be looking at the NIPS 2016 paper by M.  Defferrard,  X.  Bresson,  and  P.  Vandergheynst, on \"Convolutional Neural Networks on Graphs with Fast Localized Spectral Filtering\".<br>\n",
    "As mentioned in our previous blogs, the spatial convolution and pooling operations are well-defined only for the Euclidean domain. Hence, we cannot apply the convolution directly on the irregular structured data such as graphs.\n",
    "The technique proposed in this paper provides a way to perform convolution on graph like data, for which they used convolution theorem. According to which, Convolution in spatial domain is equivalent to multiplication in Fourier domain. Hence, instead of performing convolution explicitly in the spatial domain, we will transform the graph data and the filter into Fourier domain. Do element-wise multiplication and the result is converted back to spatial domain by performing inverse Fourier transform. Following figure illustrates the proposed technique:\n",

    "When we do eigen-decomposition of the Laplacian, we get the orthonormal eigenvectors, as the Laplacian is real symmetric positive semi-definite matrix (side note: positive semidefinite matrices have orthogonal eigenvectors and symmetric matrix has real eigenvalues). These eigenvectors are denoted by $\\{ϕ_l\\}^n_{l=0}$ and also called as Fourier modes. The corresponding eigenvalues $\\{λ_l\\}^n_{l=0}$ acts as frequencies of the graph.<br>\n",

    "In case of images, the pooling operation consists of taking a fixed size patch of pixels, say 2x2, and keeping only the pixel with max value (assuming you apply max pooling) and discarding the other pixels from the patch. Similar concept of pooling can be applied to graphs.\n",

    "Defferrard  et  al.  address  this  issue  by using the coarsening phase of the Graclus multilevel clustering algorithm. Graclus’ greedy rule consists, at each coarsening level, in picking an unmarked vertex $i$ and matching it with one of its unmarked neighbors $j$ that maximizes the local normalized cut $Wij(1/di+ 1/dj)$.  The two matched vertices are then marked and the coarsened weights are set as the sum of their weights.  The matching is repeated until all nodes have been explored. This is an very fast coarsening scheme which divides the number of nodes by approximately two from one level to the next coarser level. After coarsening, the nodes of the input graph and its coarsened version are rearranged into a balanced binary tree.  Arbitrarily  aggregating  the  balanced  binary  tree  from bottom to top will arrange similar nodes together. Pooling such a  rearranged  signal  is  much  more  efficient  than  pooling  the original. The following figure shows the example of graph coarsening and pooling.\n",
