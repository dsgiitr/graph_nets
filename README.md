This repo is a supplement to our blog series *Explained: Graph Representation Learning*. The following major papers and corresponding blogs have been covered as part of the series and we look to add blogs on a few other significant works in the field.


<h2> Setup </h2>

Clone the git repository :

```
git clone https://github.com/dsgiitr/graph_nets.git
```

Python 3 with Pytorch 1.3.0 are the primary requirements. The `requirements.txt` file contains a listing of other dependencies. To install all the requirements, run the following:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Unsupervised online learning approach, inspired from word2vec in NLP, but, here the goal is to generate node embeddings.

<h2 align="center"> 2. A Review : Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) </h2>
<img align="right" width="500x" src="/GCN/img/gcn_architecture.png">

GCNs draw on the idea of Convolution Neural Networks re-defining them for the non-euclidean data domain. They are  convolutional, because filter parameters are typically shared over all locations in the graph unlike typical GNNs.

<h2 align="center"> 3. Graph SAGE(SAmple and aggreGatE) </h2>
<img align="right" width="500x" src="/GraphSAGE/img/GraphSAGE_cover.jpg">

Previous approaches are transductive and don't naturally generalize to unseen nodes. GraphSAGE is an inductive framework leveraging node feature information to efficiently generate node embeddings.

<img align="right" width="600x" src="https://i.ibb.co/QcfhJRJ/Screenshot-2020-09-17-at-6-50-27-AM.jpg">

ChebNet is a formulation of CNNs in the context of spectral graph theory.

<img align="right" width="500x" src="/GAT/img/GAT_Cover.jpg">

GAT is able to attend over their neighborhoodsâ€™ features, implicitly specifying different weights to different nodes in a neighborhood, without requiring any kind of costly matrix operation or depending on knowing the graph structure upfront.
