    "We can define a graph as a picture that represent the data in an organised manner. Let's go deep into applied graph theory. A graph(being directed or undirected) consists of set of vertices(or nodes) denoted by V and a set of edges denoted by E. Edges can be weighted or binary. Let's have a look of a graph. \n",

These weights can represent different quantities.For example if we consider these nodes as different cities, edges can be the distance between these cities."

    "\n",
    " - __Node__ : A node is a person in the graph. Every person has a corresponding node and every node corresponds to one person. It is represented  by circles in the graph.\n",
    " - __Edge__ : It is the line joining two nodes in a graph. Presence of an edge between two nodes indices that the two nodes have interacted with each other. It is represented by straight lines in the graph.\n",
    " - __Degree of a vertex__ -The degree of a vertex V of a graph G (denoted by deg (V)) is the number of edges incident with the vertex V. As an instance consider node B, it has 3 outgoing edges and 1 incoming edge, so outdegree is 3 and indegree is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    " - __Adjacency Matrix__ : It is a method of representing a graph using only a square Matrix. Suppose there are N nodes there in a graph then there will be N rows and N columns in the corresponding adjacency matrix. The i'th row will contain a 1 in the j'th column if there is an edge between the i'th and the j'th node otherwise it will contain a 0.\n",

    "## What is GCN\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look around us, what we observe is that most of the real-world datasets come in the form of graphs or networks: social networks, protein-interaction networks, the World Wide Web, etc. As the name suggests, Graph Convolution Networks (GCN), draw on the idea of Convolution Neural Networks re-defining them for the graph domain. As we know a regular convolutional neural network captures the surrounding information of each pixel of an image. As for images, the convolution framework aims to capture neighbourhood information for graph nodes also.\n",
    "\n",
    "GCN is basically a neural network that operates on a graph. It will take a graph as an input and give some meaningful output. It is a very powerful method that can work on a large number of graphs with very little about of human help. Even if the information about only 2 nodes is given it can predict for the graph with very high accuracy rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "GCNs come in two varieties: Spectral GCNs and Spatial GCNs.Spectral-based approaches define graph convolutions by introducing filters from the perspective of graph signal processing which is based on graph spectral theory. Spatial-based approaches formulate graph convolutions as aggregating feature information from neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral approach has the limitation of the graph structure being same for all samples i.e. homogeneous structure. But it is a hard constraint, as most of the real-world graph data has different structures and size for different samples i.e. heterogeneous structure. On the other hand we have spatial approach which does not require homogeneous graph structure.\n",

    "One possible application of GCN is in the Facebook's friend prediction algorithm. Consider three people A, B and C. Given that A is a friend of B, B is a friend of C. You are also given some information about each person, now you have to predict whether A is friend of C. Today we will be discussing about a simpler version of this problem."

    "Now first I will show you a very simple method for predicting the Friend Prediction problem and then we will generalize this to work with much better success rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement: You are given N persons and also a graph where there is an edge between two people if they are friends.  Now you have to predict whether two persons will become friend in future or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple graph corresponding to this problem is:\n",
    "![img](friends_graph.png)\n",
    "Here person (1,2) are friends, similarly (2,3), (3,4), (4,1), (5,6),(6,8), (8,7), (7,6) are also friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are interested in finding out whether a given pair of person will become friend in future or not. Lets say that the pair we are interested in in (1,3), now since they have 2 common friends implies they have a high chance of becoming friends, whereas the node (1,5) have no friend in common so they are much less likely to become friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take another example:\n",
    "![img](friends_graph2.png)\n",
    "Here (1,11) are much more likely to become friends than say (3, 11).\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can say that nodes that are closer are much more likely to be similar than the nodes that are far from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the next question that arises is 'How to implement this?'. GCN's implement it in a way similar to CNNs. In CNN we apply a filter on the original image to get the representation in next layer. Similarly in GCN we apply a filter which creates the next layer representation. Mathematically, \n",

    "But in this we will be facing two major problems:\n",
    " - Value of node is not a function of its previous value : As you can see the value of a node is only a function of its neighbours but not of the node itself. We can overcome this by adding self loops, that is an edge starting and ending on the same node, in this way a node will become a neighbour of itself.\n",
    " - Nodes that have large number of neighbours will get much more input from them and hence will have a large value, and this value will grow very fast. To deal with this we will be using normalisation ,i.e, reduce all values in such a way that the values dont explode.\n"
